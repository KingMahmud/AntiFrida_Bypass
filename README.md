# AntiFrida_Bypass

Generic script to bypass some frida checks(anti frida)

Please star or fork it if you use it -> it will give me confidence that the community likes it

Feel free to send more bypasses as a PR or improve it.

**PS : It won't support for bypassing frida checks with direct syscalls yet**

Roadmap -
1. Add syscall check bypass
2. Add more frida strings
3. Add more method which might check frida's presence
4. Something you guys can suggest me
